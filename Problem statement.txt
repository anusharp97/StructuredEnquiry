Problem Statement:
Database fields validation, explicitly on the
backend.
Form validation is important especially before
pushing the data into database. Your task is the
following:
1) Create a frontend UI where the user inputs his
data to be pushed in a database, the database
should be have the following fields:
userID, number
userName, string
userPhone, number
userEmail, string
dateJoined, datetime
lastUpdated, datetime
2) Push this data into a database and make sure all
the fields are validated.
3) The validation has to happen explicitly on the
backend (node) not on the frontend (angular)
Give an option in frontend to query for specific user
based on user id and get all the details.
